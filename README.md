## Introduction

The **Hospital Management System** is designed to demonstrate the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The system provides functionality to add, edit, delete, and sort records for hospitals, doctors, and patients.

This project was developed as part of the **OOP course** at **AITU** to showcase how Java can be used to build real-world applications.
